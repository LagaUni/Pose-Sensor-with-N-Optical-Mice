# Pose-Sensor-with-N-Optical-Mice
Design of an optical pose sensor based on sensor fusion of N optical mice sensors (FCT3065-XY model from Bluetooth mice) to estimate the pose and real time odometry of an autonomous differential drive robot. Communication protocol with the sensors via bit banging in Arduino [[1]], design of data processing code in Python and display interface using a URDF node model in ROS2.
